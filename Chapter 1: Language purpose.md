### Why was the language created?

About the origin of [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language), the creator [Gudio van Rossum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum) wrote in 1996 that he was bored during Christmas so that he created Python for killing time. He decided to develop a new script as descendant of programming language [ABC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_(programming_language) that would appeal to Unix/C hackers. He named the script Python since he is a big fan of Monty Pythonâ€™s Flying Circus.

### What problems was the language trying to address?

Python is a high-level general-purpose programming language that can be applied to many different classes of problems.
The language comes with a large standard library that covers areas such as string processing (regular expressions, Unicode, calculating differences between files), Internet protocols ([HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol), [FTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol), [SMTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol), [XML-RPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML-RPC), [POP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_Office_Protocol), [IMAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Message_Access_Protocol), [CGI programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Gateway_Interface)), software engineering (unit testing, logging, profiling, parsing Python code), and operating system interfaces (system calls, filesystems, TCP/IP sockets).([Details by clicking here](https://docs.python.org/3/faq/general.html#what-is-python-good-for))

### Is the language a reaction to a previous language or a replacement for another language?

Python is a descendant of programming language [ABC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_(programming_language). Guido thought [ABC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_(programming_language) was not successful because it was not open source. Therefore, he focused on open source and combination of other programming languages during Python development.
