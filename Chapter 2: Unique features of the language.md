# Chapter 2: Unique features of the language

### Does the language have any particularly unique features?

## Python

Most language features in existence have been adopted in more than one language since their inception. Most of the features of Python can be found in other languages. Not so many languages have them all. It is the combination of ease of use and power that makes Python stand out.

## C# #

C# introduced assembly, which is a level of encapsulation above the typical namespaces or modules in most languages.
C# also has the concept of Partial Class, which allows a class member to be defined in multiple places/files.
