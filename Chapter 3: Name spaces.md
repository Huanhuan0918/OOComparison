# Chapter 3: Name spaces

## Python

### How are name spaces implemented?

A _namespace_ is a mapping from names to objects. Namespaces in Python are implemented as Python dictionaries, this means it is a mapping from names (keys) to objects (values).

### How are name spaces used?

Many programming languages use namespaces or contexts for identifiers. An identifier defined in a namespace is associated with that namespace. This way, the same identifier can be independently defined in multiple namespaces. The important thing to know about namespaces is that there is absolutely no relation between names in different namespaces; for instance, two different modules may both define a function maximize without confusion.
