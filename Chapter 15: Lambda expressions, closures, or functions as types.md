# Chapter 15: Lambda expressions, closures, or functions as types

## Python

The lambda operator or lambda function is a way to create small anonymous functions, i.e. functions without a name. These functions are throw-away functions, i.e. they are just needed where they have been created. Lambda functions are mainly used in combination with the functions `filter()`, `map()` and `reduce()`.
The following example of a lambda function returns the sum of its two arguments:

```
>>> f = lambda x, y : x + y
>>> f(1,1)
2
```

In Python, lambda-expression may only have a single expression for its body, and no `return` statement is permitted. In Java, you can do something like this: `(int a, int b) -> { return a * b; };` and other optional things as well.
