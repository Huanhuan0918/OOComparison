### Why was the language created?

About the origin of [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language), the creator [Gudio van Rossum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum) wrote in 1996 that he was bored during Christmas so that he created Python for killing time. He decided to develop a new script as descendant of programming language [ABC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_(programming_language) that would appeal to Unix/C hackers. He named the script Python since he is a big fan of Monty Python’s Flying Circus.

### What problems was the language trying to address?

Python is a high-level general-purpose programming language that can be applied to many different classes of problems.
The language comes with a large standard library that covers areas such as string processing (regular expressions, Unicode, calculating differences between files), Internet protocols ([HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol), [FTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol), [SMTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol), [XML-RPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML-RPC), [POP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_Office_Protocol), [IMAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Message_Access_Protocol), [CGI programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Gateway_Interface)), software engineering (unit testing, logging, profiling, parsing Python code), and operating system interfaces (system calls, filesystems, TCP/IP sockets).([Details by clicking here](https://docs.python.org/3/faq/general.html#what-is-python-good-for))

### Is the language a reaction to a previous language or a replacement for another language?

Python is a descendant of programming language [ABC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_(programming_language). Guido thought [ABC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_(programming_language) was not successful because it was not open source. Therefore, he focused on open source and combination of other programming languages during Python development.

## C`#`

### Why was the language created?

C# was designed for the Common language infrastructure, and serves as a general-purpose, OOP language. (From Wikipedia)
In my own opinion, it’s more like a Microsoft’s monopoly. They build .Net framework aiming at desktop applications and web applications on Windows and C# is most commonly used in the framework. In northeastern areas in US, IT department of most non-IT companies purchase Microsoft license as a whole, and using C# as one of their developing languages.  

### What problems was the language trying to address?

It should support existing software engineering principles such as strong type checking, array bound checking, detection of attempts to use uninitialized variables, source code portability and automatic garbage collection; also be suitable for deployment in distributed environment, and suitable for hosted or embedded systems. 

### Is the language a reaction to a previous language or a replacement for another language?

On syntax level, C# is closer to C/C++; on feature level, C# is closer to java.
