# Chapter 13: Null/nil references

## Python

### Which does the language use?

Null.

### Does the language have features for handling null/nil references?

The `Null` object is returned by functions that donâ€™t explicitly return a value. It supports no special operations. There is exactly one `null` object, named `None` (a built-in name). `type(None)()` produces the same singleton. It is written as `None`.
